# Demo-iOS-NibLoading
An example of different ways to load NIB/XIB files in iOS.

There's (currently) two options displayed in here; there are more than just these in the world, certainly, but these two both exemplify the idea of loading a "raw" NIB/XIB file, using it purely as a "resource-oriented" way to construct a user interface at runtime.

## Option One: Everything in place

## Option Two: Raw NIB/XIB, wrapped in custom UIView subclass
